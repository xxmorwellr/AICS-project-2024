# AICS-project-2024
It's a public repository to store my project for my master course *Artificial Intelligence: Cognitive Systems*. In this course, we have learned a lot about grouded language, computer vision and human-robot interaction. 

For my course project, I want to explore if interactive learning can improve spatial reasoning in Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. I am intended to utilize CLEVR dataset and realize an online, incremental learning approach.
